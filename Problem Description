Problem Description:

A team of rebellious developers have formed a software consultancy company called WorkerThoughts. In their desire to launch their corporate website and tackle the social web's undercurrents, they have approached you to help them build their front page.

They got together over photoshop one night, and after much creative time wasting came up with the image mock-up you see below.


They would like you take their creative masterpiece to the next level, by building an HTML web page, styled with the latest C`SS Voodoo.

Being considerate maniacs, they have also provided images to help you with this task. 

Most clients expect perfect code right from the start, but being Agile developers, they are prioritizing following outcomes from your work:

a) The semantics of the markup over the pixel perfection of the layout.
b) The maintainability of your CSS over fancy effects in css
c) The readability of your CSS and Mark up over the performance metrics of your code in a browser
d) Adherence to web standards over browser hacks.

Thats not to say they do not value the items on the right. Armed with IE7, Firefox, and Intype(editor), they expect that this exercise will be a proof of your skills, but do not intend to give you more than an hour to prove them.
